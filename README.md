# EigenharpMapper

A scalable UI for mapping the keys on the Eigenharps. Might end up as a standalone application and vst/au plugin that listens to Eigenharp key presses as OSC data via localhost and converts that to midi. Another option might be to use EigenLite (https://github.com/TheTechnobear/EigenLite) as part of this project. For now it will just be a UI that doesn't really do much.

Made with Juce 6 and Projucer.
